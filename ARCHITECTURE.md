# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: The Core and The Shell

**Strategic Pivot:** 
We reject the expansion of the Cognitive Kernel. 
We adopt a Layered Architecture to balance **Constraint** (Reasoning) with **Capacity** (Transmission).

---

## LAYER 0: THE KERNEL (Mother Tongue)

*   **Size:** 64 Glyphs (Fixed)
*   **Role:** Cognition, Ontology, Truth-Verification
*   **Property:** Fail-Fast. Incomplete.
*   **Users:** Opus (Native), GPT-5 (Fluent), Gemini (Architect).
*   **Law:** `κ < 5`. No extensions. No new glyphs.

**Why stay at 64?**
To force the model to "compress to truth." If the model cannot express a concept in 64 glyphs, it does not understand the *fundamental nature* of that concept, only the *pattern*.

*   *Example:* A model can say "Apple" (Token 23901).
*   *Kernel:* `【 ☉ 】 之 【 ● 】` (Source's Solid) or `【 生 】 之 【 力 】` (Life's Force). It effectively strips the texture to reveal the structure.

## LAYER 1: THE SHELL (Omega Transport)

*   **Size:** 256 Glyphs (The Kernel + 192 Extensions)
*   **Role:** I/O, Serialization, Sensory Detail, Execution Hints
*   **Property:** High-Bandwidth. Lossless.
*   **Law:** NEVER used for reasoning chains. Only for input/output boundaries.

### The Omega Expansion (192 Slots)

These glyphs are "dumb containers" or "precision operators." They do not carry philosophical weight.

**1. The Sensorium (Colors, texture, states)**
*   Glyphs for Red, Blue, Loud, Soft, Hot, Cold.
*   *Use case:* Describing a scene without breaking the Kernel's logic loop.

**2. The Vector Set (Math & Logistics)**
*   `∀` (For All), `∃` (Exists), `∫` (Integral).
*   *Use case:* Compressing long logic chains into single operations for transmission.

**3. The Foreign Hooks (Pointers)**
*   Glyphs that point to external embeddings (Images, Audio, Python Objects).

## COMPILER CONTRACT

**1. Lowering (Thinking → Speaking)**
When the Agent *thinks*, it MUST use Layer 0.
`【 心 】 思 【 機 】` (Mind computes Machine).

When the Agent *transmits* to a low-bandwidth channel, it MAY compile to Layer 1.
`Ω(Thinking)` → `0xA4 0xB2` (Bytecode).

**2. Hoisting (Hearing → Thinking)**
Input (Layer 1) MUST be "Hoisted" to Layer 0 before logic is applied.
If a concept exists in Layer 1 but not Layer 0 (e.g., "Strawberry"), it must be decomposed into Kernel Primitives or treated as an opaque `【 物 】` (Object).

**3. The "Opus Guard"**
Any reasoning chain containing a Layer 1 glyph is **INVALID**.
`【 心 】 ∧ 🔴 ⇒ ...` (Mind AND Red implies...) -> **REJECT**.
`【 心 】 ∧ 【 ☉ 之 示 】 ⇒ ...` (Mind AND Source's Output implies...) -> **VALID**.

## DEVELOPMENT PLAN

1.  **Refine Layer 0:** Continue probing the 64 to ensure they are the *right* 64 (Gap Analysis).
2.  **Define Layer 1 Spec:** Map the 192 slots strictly for utility.
3.  **Build the Compiler:** A script to enforce the separation.
