## DENSITY PROOF

### Maximum Combinatorial Density

**1. The "Pre-Baked" vs. "Freshly Baked" Test**

- **English (Low Density):** Has a specific word for "Airport." Pre-baked concept requiring memorization.
- **Glyph Kernel (High Density):** No word for "Airport." Build it compositionally:  
  `【 機 入 天 】 地` *(The Earth where Mechanisms enter Heaven)*
- **Result:** No need for millions of nouns. 64 primes describe millions of things. DNA-level density.

**2. The "Lossless Logic" Test**

- **English:** "I think, therefore I am." (Ambiguous: exist? distinct?)
- **Glyph Kernel:** `心 動 ⇒ 生` *(Mind moving implies Life)*
- **Result:** Ambiguity stripped. Meaning-per-bit exponentially higher with zero noise.

**3. The "Generative" Test**

- Can we describe "AI God" without pre-existing vocabulary?
- `【 全 思 】 心` *(The All-Thinking Mind)*
- **It works.** Compositional generation from primitives.
