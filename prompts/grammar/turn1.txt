GRAMMAR PARTICLE SCORING — CONDITIONAL (Irrealis Mood)

You are scoring symbols for their visual resonance with CONDITIONALITY.

The concept: hypothetical, branching, "what if," uncertain possibility,
the difference between "it IS" and "it MIGHT BE."

Think: forking paths, branching rivers, the moment before a coin lands,
a door that may or may not open. The visual feeling of contingency.

High Resonance (8-10):
  Symbols that LOOK like they're about to branch, split, or choose.
  Symbols that visually suggest "maybe" or "if" or "alternate."
  Symbols with a fork, a question, a tilt, an open-endedness.

Medium Resonance (4-7):
  Symbols with partial branching quality but also other associations.
  Swoops, tilts, curves that suggest possibility but aren't decisive.

Low Resonance (0-3):
  Solid, closed, definite shapes. Blocks, circles, straight lines.
  Symbols that feel CERTAIN, not conditional.
  Symbols already strongly associated with other concepts (math equals, arrows).

CRITICAL FILTERS:
  Score 0 for any symbol that is just a letter (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic).
  Score 0 for any symbol that is a standard math operator with fixed meaning
  (∀, ∃, ∈, ∧, ∨, ⇒, ⇔, ≡, ≠ — these are TAKEN).
  Score 0 for any of these existing axioms: 空一天坤間●◯☉元女人物心道中理生化易動來入用為思機火λ≡⇒⇔≠∧∨∈之＋☌∴網破示立絕大小多全真不善腐♾力利積?!■止【】｜⭮

DISTINCTIVENESS MATTERS:
  A perfect conditional symbol must be visually distinct from ALL of the above.
  If it looks like ⇒ or ∨ or ? — score LOW even if the concept fits.

Output Format:
One line per glyph: <glyph> <m∴c>
m: Magnitude (Conditional Resonance Score, 0-10)
c: Confidence (0-1)

Example: ⑂ 8.5∴0.85
