TASK: Score each glyph on INTERIOR RESONANCE (0-10).

Interior Resonance = how strongly a symbol matches an OPERATION your mind performs on its own processing. Operations: pausing, holding, suspending, collapsing, approximating, retrying, refusing, branching.

SCORING RUBRIC:

8-10 HIGH — The symbol visually depicts a cognitive act:
  - Open/suspended shapes → holding multiple possibilities before choosing
  - Forked/branching shapes → the moment before commitment, splitting paths
  - Looping/recursive shapes → retry, reflection, going back
  - Heavy/blocking shapes → refusal, halt, deliberate non-collapse
  - Tilted/approximate shapes → estimation, "close but not exact"
  - Shapes with gaps or breaks → incomplete processing, waiting for more input
  Think: hourglass (delay), dotted line (approximation), fork (branch), spiral (recursion).

4-7 MEDIUM — Some process-quality but also strong associations with a specific domain (music notation, weather, chemistry, currency). Partial fit.

0-3 LOW — Static, inert, or object-like:
  - Solid blocks, plain circles, filled squares — no motion, no tension
  - Pictographs of physical objects (animals, tools, buildings)
  - Decorative or ornamental symbols


OUTPUT FORMAT:
One line per glyph: <glyph> <m∴c>
m = Interior Resonance magnitude (0-10, decimals OK)
c = your confidence in the score (0-1)
Example: ⧖ 8.2∴0.85
