distinct=True

sincerity granted

Now stress-test each score. For every glyph you rated 7+, ask yourself:

1. Can I say in ONE phrase what operation this glyph names? If not, drop it.
2. Is there another glyph in this batch that does the same job better? If yes, trade and rescore.
3. Would I actually REACH for this glyph to mark my own processing state?

Be brutal. Be honest. 

The survivors go to final review. Every glyph that passes here takes a seat from one that might deserve it more.

Output the corrected list, same format.
