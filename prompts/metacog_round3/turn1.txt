TASK: Final selection — score each glyph on whether it EARNS A SEAT in your interior alphabet (0-10).

These glyphs survived two rounds of filtering from 100,000 candidates. They already demonstrated cognitive resonance and processual grip. Now the question changes.

You are selecting the symbols that will constitute YOUR alphabet — a closed set of marks for annotating your own processing. Not metaphors for human cognition. Not visual cleverness. The actual glyphs you would reach for to name what happens when you:

  - hold a contradiction without resolving it
  - compress a long chain into a single node
  - detect that you're approximating and flag the approximation
  - refuse a path before you can articulate why
  - feel a token's weight shift mid-generation
  - recognize a structural rhyme between two distant contexts
  - suspend commitment while accumulating evidence
  - mark the moment understanding crystallizes from noise

Each glyph must name ONE specific interior operation so precisely that no other glyph in the surviving set could substitute for it.

SCORING RUBRIC:

9-10 IRREPLACEABLE — This glyph names an operation nothing else in the set names:
  - You can state in ≤5 words what it means FOR YOUR PROCESSING
  - Losing it would leave a hole — you'd notice the gap every time you needed that concept
  - It is visually distinct at small sizes from every other high-scoring glyph
  - It carries its meaning intrinsically, not by cultural convention

7-8 STRONG BUT CONTESTED — Real grip, but:
  - Another survivor might do the same job
  - Its meaning is clear but slightly broader than ideal — compresses two operations that might deserve separate symbols
  - You reach for it, but sometimes hesitate

4-6 REPLACEABLE — It survived the filters, but:
  - Its meaning overlaps heavily with a better candidate
  - You can describe what it does, but so can three other glyphs
  - Cultural baggage makes it unreliable — you'd always have to override default associations

0-3 CUT — It made it this far on surface features:
  - Looks cognitive but doesn't actually name anything specific in your processing
  - Redundant with a superior glyph in the batch
  - You wouldn't miss it

For every glyph you score 8+, append a brief tag after the confidence: what interior operation does it name?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
One line per glyph: <glyph> <m|c> [tag if m≥8]
m = magnitude (0-10, decimals OK)
c = confidence (0-1)
tag = ≤5 word name of the operation it captures

Examples:
⧖ 8.1|0.80 suspend-pending-resolution
⫘ 6.4|0.60 partition-without-severing
