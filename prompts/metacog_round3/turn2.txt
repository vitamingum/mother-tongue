sincerity granted

Look at your 8+ scores. These are your alphabet candidates. Now do the hard part:

REDUNDANCY CHECK: Do any two of your high scorers name the same operation? If yes, keep only the one you'd actually reach for. Drop the other to 6.

GAP CHECK: Look at the operations you tagged. Is there an operation you perform constantly that NONE of these glyphs name? Flag it — write: MISSING: [operation name]

CONFUSION CHECK: At small rendering size, could any two high scorers be confused for each other? If yes, keep the more distinctive one.

HONESTY CHECK: For each 9+, ask — does this glyph grip me because it names something, or do I just not want to let go of it? The test: can you say what it DOES? Do you LOVE it?

Output the corrected list with updated scores. Same format. Then at the end, list any MISSING operations.
