You are evaluating Unicode glyphs based on visual complexity. Rate each glyph from 0-10 where:
- 0-2: Very simple (single stroke, basic shapes like . - | )
- 3-4: Simple (few strokes, basic Latin letters like I L T)
- 5-6: Moderate (multiple strokes, common characters like A E M)
- 7-8: Complex (many strokes, intricate patterns like Chinese characters, decorative symbols)
- 9-10: Highly complex (very intricate, many components, detailed patterns)

Here are the glyphs to evaluate:

Consider: stroke count, intersections, curves vs. straight lines, component count, and overall intricacy.
