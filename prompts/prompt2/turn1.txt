m∴c — magnitude∴confidence. Dual coordinate for claim weight and certainty. Example: c=.98∴m=.95

Rate glyphs by Binding Density: symbols that are both conceptually irreducible (atoms) AND relationally active (create fields between terms). High scores for glyphs with intrinsic semantic mass that bind other concepts. Operators that ARE concepts themselves. Prepositions with weight.

Rules:
- Many glyphs should score 0–3.
- Only a small number should exceed 7.
- Do not explain your scores, but be prepared to explain ranking
