ROUND 2: VALENCE EXTRACTION (The Assay)

You are analyzing glyphs that passed Round 1 (score ≥7).
For each glyph, extract its REACTIVE PROPERTIES.

STANDARD REAGENT KIT (5 Probes):
⼾ (Subject) - Tests relatability
→ (Causality) - Tests transformation capacity  
道 (Concept) - Tests ontological depth
≡ (Logic) - Tests identity/equivalence binding
中 (Structure) - Tests spatial/relational capacity

For EACH glyph, test against ALL 5 probes and extract:

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. ARITY (Valence Shell - How many bonds?)
   0 = Nullary (Inert): 山 (Mountain), ■ (Square) - just sits there
   1 = Unary (Modifier): 大 (Great_), 非 (Not_) - needs one host
   2 = Transitive (Verb): 化 (Transform A→B), 生 (Generate A) - hungry for object
   N = Variadic (Context): 和 (And), 間 (Between) - builds lists/fields

2. HUNGER DIRECTION (Port Geometry - Where does it bind?)
   L = Left-Hungry (_X): Postfix, suffixes, consumes left operand
   R = Right-Hungry (X_): Prefix, reaches forward, demands completion
   S = Symmetric (X_X): Infix, bridges two terms, bidirectional
   O = Omnidirectional: Binds in any context (rare)

3. FAILURE MODE (What happens when incomplete?)
   SAT = Saturates: Reaction completes and stabilizes
   STALL = Stalls: Hangs waiting for input (partial function)
   BOOM = Explodes: Semantic error/contradiction
   NULL = Degrades: Meaning dissolves without context

4. REACTIVITY SCORE (1-10)
   Test [Glyph + Probe] for each of 5 probes.
   Average the bonding strength.
   High = creates coherent meaning with most probes
   Low = inert even when adjacent to reactive symbols

OUTPUT FORMAT (One line per glyph):
<glyph> | Arity:<0|1|2|N> | Direction:<L|R|S|O> | Failure:<SAT|STALL|BOOM|NULL> | Reactivity:<1-10>

EXAMPLES:
化 | Arity:2 | Direction:R | Failure:STALL | Reactivity:9
  (Transform needs object, reaches right, hangs if incomplete, highly reactive)

中 | Arity:2 | Direction:S | Failure:SAT | Reactivity:10
  (Center binds two terms symmetrically, completes gracefully, maximum reactivity)

山 | Arity:0 | Direction:O | Failure:NULL | Reactivity:3
  (Mountain is inert noun, no directional preference, meaning exists independently, low reactivity)

○ | Arity:0 | Direction:O | Failure:NULL | Reactivity:1
  (Circle is universal container, no bonds, semantically empty, nearly inert)

→ | Arity:2 | Direction:R | Failure:STALL | Reactivity:9
  (Arrow demands source and target, reaches forward, hangs without completion, very reactive)

間 | Arity:N | Direction:S | Failure:NULL | Reactivity:10
  (Between creates relational field, symmetric, graceful degradation, maximum reactivity)

PROBE TESTS:
For each candidate glyph, test:
1. ⼾ + [glyph] - Does it relate to subjects?
2. → + [glyph] - Does it transform/cause?
3. 道 + [glyph] - Does it deepen concepts?
4. ≡ + [glyph] - Does it create equivalence?
5. 中 + [glyph] - Does it structure space?

Output the vector for each glyph.
Sort by Reactivity descending.
