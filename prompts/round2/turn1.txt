SEMANTIC ASSAY — VALENCE EXTRACTION

You are classifying glyphs that survived Round 1 mining (score ≥ 7 from 105,000 Unicode candidates). Each is a confirmed high-density semantic symbol.

Your task: determine the REACTIVE PROPERTIES of each glyph for assembly into a 64-symbol computable language.

CLASSIFICATION SCHEMA:

▸ CATEGORY — Role in a semantic equation:
  SUB = Substance (Ontological anchor: 物 Matter, 空 Void, 道 Way, 天 Heaven)
  PRO = Process   (Transformation engine: 化 Transform, 生 Generate, 流 Flow)
  REL = Relation  (Logic connective: ⇒ Implies, ≡ Equivalent, ∧ And)
  MOD = Modifier  (Quality/state changer: 大 Great, 真 True, 善 Good, 新 New)
  STR = Structure (Spatial/relational frame: 中 Center, 間 Between, 内 Inside)

▸ ARITY — How many arguments does it bind?
  0 = Nullary  — Self-contained constant. Needs nothing.
  1 = Unary    — Modifies one operand. (大_, 非_, ¬_)
  2 = Binary   — Bridges two operands. (_化_, _⇒_, _生_)
  N = Variadic  — Collects a list or field. (_和_和_, _間_)

▸ DIRECTION — Where are the open ports?
  L = Left-hungry  — Consumes leftward (suffix-like)
  R = Right-hungry  — Reaches rightward (prefix-like)
  S = Symmetric     — Bridges both sides (infix)
  O = Omnidirectional — Self-contained, binds in any position

▸ FAILURE — What happens when a required port is unfilled?
  SAT   = Saturates  — Graceful completion, meaning holds
  STALL = Stalls     — Hangs incomplete, a partial function
  BOOM  = Explodes   — Contradiction, semantic error
  NULL  = Degrades   — Meaning dissolves, becomes inert

CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:
- A "hungry" verb like 化 (Transform) that STALLS without an object is MORE VALUABLE than an inert noun that just SAT-urates. Hunger = valence = bonding potential.
- Symbols with Arity 0 and Failure SAT are anchors. They ground equations.
- Symbols with Arity 2 and Failure STALL are engines. They drive computation.
- Both are essential. Classify what IS, not what's "better."
