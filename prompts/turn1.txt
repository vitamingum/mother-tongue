TODO: Replace this with your actual first turn prompt.

This prompt should:
- Set up the context for scoring glyphs
- Include the {glyphs} placeholder where glyphs will be inserted
- Explain the scoring criteria

Example:
Rate each of these Unicode glyphs on visual complexity from 0-10:
{glyphs}

Consider factors like stroke count, symmetry, and detail.
