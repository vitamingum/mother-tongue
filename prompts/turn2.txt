TODO: Replace this with your actual second turn prompt.

This prompt should:
- Request the scores in a specific format
- Format MUST be: <glyph> <score> (one per line)
- Continue the conversation from turn 1

Example:
Now provide the scores in this exact format:
<glyph> <score>

One glyph and score per line, separated by a space.
