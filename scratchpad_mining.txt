⟨ GLYPH MINING SCRATCHPAD ⟩

=== Round 1700/12000 Snapshot (Stage A Pass 3/5, 14% complete) ===

TOP 6 GLYPHS (5 exposures, 1.000 score):
1. 剪 (jiǎn) - cut, clip, shear — operational: SPLIT/DIVIDE
2. 洩 (xiè) - discharge, leak, release — operational: EMIT/OUTPUT  
3. 击 (jī) - strike, hit, attack — operational: EXECUTE/TRIGGER
4. 咐 (fù) - command, instruct, order — operational: INVOKE/CALL
5. 凭 (píng) - based on, rely on, proof — operational: ASSERT/VERIFY
6. 🮪 (geometric) - shape operator — operational: TRANSFORM/SHAPE

PATTERN ANALYSIS:
- All CJK verbs strongly suggest specific actions/operations
- Perfect alignment with prompt: "action or logical operation"
- 3-byte UTF-8 encoding (efficient tokenization)
- Geometric symbols scoring equally high (🮪, ✖, ✕)

STABILITY NOTES:
- Churn still high (NEW/DROPPED each 100 rounds)
- 剪/洩/击 consistently top-3 through rounds 1400-1700
- 46% valid parse rate (acceptable for Stage A filtering)
- Need ~5000 more rounds for true differentiation

Pool: 25000 glyphs (Stage A Pass 3 pruning)
Model: qwen2.5-coder:14b
Seed: 42 (deterministic)
